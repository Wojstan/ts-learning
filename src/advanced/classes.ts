// Create a Class

// Description: Define a TypeScript class called Person with properties name and age. Create an instance of this class and initialize its properties.

// Task: Write the Person class with a constructor to initialize the name and age properties, and create an instance of this class with sample data.

// Add Methods to a Class

// Description: Expand the Person class by adding a method called greet that returns a greeting message including the person's name.

// Task: Modify the Person class to include a greet method and call it on an instance of the class to display the greeting message.

// Inheritance

// Description: Create a base class Vehicle with properties make and model. Then, create a derived class Car that extends Vehicle and has an additional property year.

// Task: Define the Vehicle and Car classes with properties and a constructor, and create an instance of the Car class.

// Access Modifiers

// Description: Modify the Vehicle class from the previous exercise by making the make property private and the model property protected. Try to access these properties from within the Car class.

// Task: Update the Vehicle class with access modifiers and demonstrate accessing these properties from within the Car class.

// Static Methods

// Description: Create a class called MathUtils with a static method add that takes two numbers as parameters and returns their sum.

// Task: Define the MathUtils class with the add static method and call it to perform addition.

// Getter and Setter

// Description: Implement a class Circle with a private property radius. Create getter and setter methods for the radius property to allow getting and setting the radius value.

// Task: Define the Circle class with getter and setter methods for the radius property and demonstrate their use.

// Class with Static Properties

// Description: Create a class Counter with a static property count that keeps track of the number of instances created. Increment the count property in the class constructor.

// Task: Define the Counter class with a static count property and create multiple instances of the class to see how the count property changes.

// Class Inheritance and Method Overriding

// Description: Create a base class Animal with a method makeSound. Then, create derived classes Dog and Cat that inherit from Animal and override the makeSound method to return different sounds.

// Task: Define the Animal, Dog, and Cat classes, override the makeSound method in the derived classes, and call the method on instances of each class.

// Abstract Class

// Description: Define an abstract class Shape with an abstract method calculateArea. Create derived classes like Circle and Rectangle that inherit from Shape and implement the calculateArea method.

// Task: Define the Shape abstract class and create derived classes with implementations of the calculateArea method.

// Class Composition

// Description: Create a class Author with properties name and age, and a class Book with properties title and author (an instance of Author). Use class composition to represent a book's author.

// Task: Define the Author and Book classes, and create an instance of Book with an associated Author instance.
